    Example 1:
        Input: [4,2,3]

        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.

    Example 2:
        Input: [1,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index. 

    Example 3:
        Input: []
        Output: []
    
    Example 4:
        Input: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]
        Output: [0, 1]
        Explanation: 0 is the smallest value, but  there are two zeros,
                     so we will choose the first zero, which has the smallest index.
